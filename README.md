# Scraping-Wallets
This script was done for a quick job that never got requested :)
Basically it takes URL extension from NT.xlsx under "Address" row and scrapes the website for data, specifically: **'USD Earnings', 'ETH Earnings', 'Bytes in Wallet', 'Unclaimed Bytes', 'S1 Citizens', 'Bytes Staked'**.
At the end, it puts this data into an excel file.
